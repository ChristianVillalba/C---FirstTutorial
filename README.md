# C# First Tutorial

First contact with C# programming language

## Description

Notes from the turtorial: [C# Tutorial For Beginners - Learn C# Basics in 1 Hour ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY).

## Notes: 
* *C & C++* programming languages when compiled, the compiler translates our code into *native code* from the machine on which it was running.
In other words, the code written in an OS with an specific arquitecture, won't work in other OSs or other hardwares.
* *C#* doesn't translate directly into the machine it is written, but in an *Intermadiate Language* (*IL*) independent of the computer on which it's running.
Then it's translated into Native Code using a *Common Language Runtime* (*CLR*)
* *CLR:* application in memeory that translates IL code into machine code (native code).    
This process is called just-in-time compilation(*JIT*) 
* This allows to code without having to worry about compiling for different machines (as long as its CLR can run our app)
